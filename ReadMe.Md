User --> request -- server (user only gives code) -- ai will process and then it will send review to server then the server sent it to frontend that is user

❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){ return a+b }
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ `a` and `b` are not defined or passed as arguments to the function. This will likely result in an error (if `a` and
`b` are not defined in the outer scope) or unexpected behavior (if they are).
* ❌ The function lacks clarity on what it's supposed to sum. It's not immediately obvious how `a` and `b` are
determined.
* ❌ Missing JSDoc documentation/comments explaining function purpose and parameters.

✅ Recommended Fix:
```javascript
/**
* Sums two numbers.
* @param {number} a - The first number.
* @param {number} b - The second number.
* @returns {number} The sum of a and b.
*/
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:
* ✔️ Takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, as input.
* ✔️ Returns the sum of `a` and `b`.
* ✔️ Includes JSDoc comments for better readability and documentation. This specifies the purpose of the function, the
types of its parameters, and the return type. This helps with maintainability and understanding.

Final Note:
Always strive to make your code self-documenting and explicit about its inputs and outputs. This simple change
drastically improves the function's usability and reduces the potential for errors.
